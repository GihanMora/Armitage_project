All businesses have cover for the loss of their building, stock inventory and contents, but is the dollar payout still enough?", "The cost of doing business seems to increase every year, so it makes sense that your insurance cover increases accordingly.

This minimum cover might be fine for a while, but as we all know, a public liability claim can reach into millions of dollars, particularly when it is a personal injury claim.", "With a million dollar shortfall between your insurance payout and the aggrieved person\u2019s compensation, your business could not only suffer a significant loss but could be forced to close its doors.
